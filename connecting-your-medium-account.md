# Connecting Your Medium Account

Seeko directly connects to your Medium account to create a seamless monetization experience for you. You can install the Seeko extension on the Google Chrome store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/seeko/mklehambljgkffljobogbelkancidlaj). 

Installing the extension enables the following features.

* [x] 1-click link tracking in your articles
* [x] 1-click link monetization for qualified links
* [x] Automatic imports of your Medium stats into Seeko \(allowing you to share it with advertisers\)

Once you've installed the extension, navigate to [Medium.com](https://medium.com) and click on the Seeko extension in your toolbar. Follow the onboarding process to get set up.

### Note on Security

We're very cognizant of the security implications of browser extensions. Seeko's extension only runs while you're visiting Medium.com and **ONLY collects your Medium stats data and the click-through metrics of your readers and NOTHING ELSE.**
